For these hacks, you will want to go ahead and get setup
with mail and bank at a minimum.

NOTE: the JSON data is all on one line
wordwrap is your friend.

before making any changes to your database
BACKUP anything you plan to replace. Just-In-Case.

hardware: This is your PC build, for home pc 
to edit home pc, browse the computer table
you will see FileSystem, Hardware, isRouter, isPlayer .... etc
you'll want to backup the hardware json you have, for the one that
isPlayer value is 1 then you can edit it or
replace that hardware section with mine.

money: This is self explanitory, money
to edit how much money is in your bank
you will first have to have an email, and bank account setup.
in the database youll want to browse BankAccounts.
the JSON in Transactions is where youll find "Dinero" this value
is how much money is in your bank. I havent found a need to 
make a "transaction" when changing the Dinero value.
